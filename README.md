##  Multi-loader Compatibility (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge)

- Separate builds exist for Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge loaders due to API differences.
- AI backend and model logic remain consistent across builds.
- Network packet handling is adapted per loaderâ€™s API.
- Test on all supported loaders to ensure compatibility.
